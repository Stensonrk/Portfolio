Hello,

I am Robert Stenson. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from University of Maryland Global Campus in December 2020. I am passionate about technology and software development. I continue to improve my skills through personal projects and freelancing. I am most experienced in Java; however, I also have experience with Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My current projects include building a personal webpage and various smart home projects based on the Raspberry Pi hardware. I am actively searching for permanent employment in the technology field.

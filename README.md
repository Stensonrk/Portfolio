Hello! I am Robert Stenson. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from UMGC in December 2020. I am seeking a career change from Restaurant/Hospitality into the Tech field. Now that my current company, AAFES, and my facility, the Fort Hood Clear Creek Food Court, has recovered from the hardships caused by COVID-19, I believe it is an appropriate time to make a career change that will not harm either myself or my current company.

I can be reached at robertk.stenson@gmail.com.
